## Notes on the Mockup

The Entire Website is based off the F shaped Pattern, hence why most of the document is structures for left to right skimming

### The Homepage 
- Menu has the link to the home button and the link to the main comparison tool. 
- Has Logo and mission statement, followed by demo of what the comparison tool actually looks like so viewers can get a good understanding of what to expect

### First Comparison Tool
- Structured so user can search what they want and select the appropriate drop down option
- Upon clicking search, they are able to parse through a listing of the available descriptions of platforms we have in our database
- They can then go to the second comparison tool which provides side by side analysis on the products listed
- Able to expand each window to see more details on each product
- Only through the first comparison tool can users get to the second comparison tool, as they need to select a product for the second comparison tool

### Second Comparison Tool
- Users are able to use drop down to select specific products they want to see visualized
- They will not be allowed to select the same product twice
- Once they do this, a side by side analysis will be shown
